== Description ==

A Simple WordPress plugin of Eden - Eden is  simply a set of reusable components, that works with any PHP framework and CMS. Eden makes code logical and readable with dead simple syntax.

Eden is a PHP Library maintained by Openovate Labs and is simply a set of reusable components, that works with any PHP framework and CMS. Eden makes code logical and readable with dead simple syntax. We use Eden as a foundation for all of our internal product development, which in turn keeps her code base updated, evolving and constantly expanding. Eden makes functionality available rather than make rules for how a website is created. This makes learning Eden easier because you only need to learn the classes you plan to use.
